              Pennsylvania man is suspected to be the gunman who attempted to
              assassinate former President Donald Trump on Saturday, firing
              several shots and killing at least one spectator, federal and
              local law enforcement agencies said. <br />
              <span className="text-primary font-semibold">The FBI </span>
              early on Sunday identified the suspect, who was killed at the
              scene, as Thomas Matthew Crooks, of Bethel Park. Firefighter Corey
              Comperatore, a dad who was attending the rally was killed and two
              other bystanders injured. The FBI did not "currently have an
              identified motive, although our investigators are working
              tirelessly to attempt to identify what that motive was,"
              Pittsburgh Special Agent in Charge Kevin Rojek said.
              <br />
              <span className="text-primary font-semibold">The highest </span>
              priority is being placed on determining motive because the bureau
              is also looking at the shooting as a "potential domestic terrorism
              act," said Robert Wells, the FBIâ€™s assistant director of the
              Counterterrorism Division.
